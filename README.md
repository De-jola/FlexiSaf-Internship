# This is my submission of Week 4 and week 5 task.

# Week 4 task

# The task specified using APIs in a react application

# Http Requests such as GET, POST, PUT and DELETE were also specified to be used

## To use, clone the repository, install vite if you haven't then run "npm run dev" on the terminal

# DO NOT VIEW ON MOBILE

#### Project Overview

# This project is a very low standard replica of Netflix using TMDb API.

# The Http Requests GET, POST and DELETE were used

# There includes a Discover, Trending, Popular, Airing Today, Tv Series, Watchlist movie tiles using GET with sliders that were implemented using react-slick-slider

#### Adding To WatchList - POST

# Double Click on any movie tile and refresh the browser. Your selected tile will be classified under Movies or Tv

# The TMDb API doesn't have a POST request so i couldn't use it in here.

#### Removing from WatchList - DELETE

# Click thrice on the movie tile you want to delete. Note do not click on the movie tiles that are already in watchList, it will not work.

# Week 5 Task

### I updated the Discover, Popular and TvSeries components to use hooks: useState, useEffect and useRef

## Created a custom Hook "useFetch" that fetches data from an API and sets movieList state. This hook is used only in the Discover and Popular components

### Closing Remarks

# This project is far from perfect, however it implements the requests from external API which is the sole purpose of this task.

# Thank you for visiting
